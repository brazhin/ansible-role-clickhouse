# Maximum number of concurrent queries.
max_concurrent_queries: 100

# Maximum memory usage (resident set size) for server process.
# Zero value or unset means default. Default is "max_server_memory_usage_to_ram_ratio" of available physical RAM.
# If the value is larger than "max_server_memory_usage_to_ram_ratio" of available physical RAM, it will be cut down.

# The constraint is checked on query execution time.
# If a query tries to allocate memory and the current memory usage plus allocation is greater
# than specified threshold, exception will be thrown.

# Maximum number of threads in the Global thread pool.
# This will default to a maximum of 10000 threads if not specified.
# This setting will be useful in scenarios where there are a large number
# of distributed queries that are running concurrently but are idling most
# of the time, in which case a higher number of threads might be required.

# Size of cache of uncompressed blocks of data, used in tables of MergeTree family.
# In bytes. Cache is single for server. Memory is allocated only on demand.
# Cache is used when 'use_uncompressed_cache' user setting turned on (off by default).
# Uncompressed cache is advantageous only for very short queries and in rare cases.

# Note: uncompressed cache can be pointless for lz4, because memory bandwidth
# is slower than multi-core decompression on some server configurations.
# Enabling it can sometimes paradoxically make queries slower.

# In bytes. Cache is single for server. Memory is allocated only on demand.

# If you enable the `min_bytes_to_use_mmap_io` setting,
# the data in MergeTree tables can be read with mmap to avoid copying from kernel to userspace.
# It makes sense only for large files and helps only if data reside in page cache.
# To avoid frequent open/mmap/munmap/close calls (which are very expensive due to consequent page faults)
# and to reuse mappings from several threads and queries,
# the cache of mapped files is maintained. Its size is the number of mapped regions (usually equal to the number of mapped files).
# The amount of data in mapped files can be monitored
# in system.metrics, system.metric_log by the MMappedFiles, MMappedFileBytes metrics
# and in system.asynchronous_metrics, system.asynchronous_metrics_log by the MMapCacheCells metric,
# and also in system.events, system.processes, system.query_log, system.query_thread_log, system.query_views_log by the
# CreatedReadBufferMMap, CreatedReadBufferMMapFailed, MMappedFileCacheHits, MMappedFileCacheMisses events.
# Note that the amount of data in mapped files does not consume memory directly and is not accounted
# in query or server memory usage - because this memory can be discarded similar to OS page cache.
# The cache is dropped (the files are closed) automatically on removal of old parts in MergeTree,
# also it can be dropped manually by the SYSTEM DROP MMAP CACHE query.

# Server time zone could be set here.

# Time zone is used when converting between String and DateTime types,

# it is used in date and time related functions, if specific time zone was not passed as an argument.

# Time zone is specified as identifier from IANA time zone database, like UTC or Africa/Abidjan.

# remote_url_allow_hosts:

# Host should be specified exactly as in URL. The name is checked before DNS resolution.
# Example: "clickhouse.com", "clickhouse.com." and "www.clickhouse.com" are different hosts.
# If port is explicitly specified in URL, the host:port is checked as a whole.
# If host specified here without port, any port with this host allowed.
# "clickhouse.com" -> "clickhouse.com:443", "clickhouse.com:80" etc. is allowed, but "clickhouse.com:80" -> only "clickhouse.com:80" is allowed.
# If the host is specified as IP address, it is checked as specified in URL. Example: "[2a02:6b8:a::a]".
# If there are redirects and support for redirects is enabled, every redirect (the Location field) is checked.

# Regular expression can be specified. RE2 engine is used for regexps.
# Regexps are not aligned: don't forget to add ^ and $. Also don't forget to escape dot (.) metacharacter
# (forgetting to do so is a common source of error).

# If element has 'incl' attribute, then for it's value will be used corresponding substitution from another file.
